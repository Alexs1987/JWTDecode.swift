**Changed:**

- Require only App Extension Safe API (in iOS) [\#20](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift/pull/20) ([hzalaz](https://github.com/hzalaz))

**Added:**

- Swift 2.3 [\#34](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift/pull/34) ([hzalaz](https://github.com/hzalaz))
- Return JWT string representation [\#19](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift/pull/19) ([hzalaz](https://github.com/hzalaz))
- Add tvOS Support [\#33](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift/pull/33) ([adolfo](https://github.com/adolfo))

**Deprecated:**

To provide a better experience while dealing with claims and converting their values to Swift types, we deprecated the following method to retrive JWT claims

```swift
public func claim<T>(name: String) -> T?
```

In favor of the following method to retrieve the claim

```swift
let claim = jwt.claim(name: "claim_name")
```

and then you can try converting it's value to the proper type like

```swift
if let email = claim.string {
    print("JWT had email \(email)")
}
```

The supported conversions are:

```swift
var string: String?
var integer: Int?
var double: Double?
var date: NSDate?
var array: [String]?
```
